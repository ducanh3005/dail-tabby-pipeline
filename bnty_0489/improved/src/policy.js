// The policy engine.

// A request is measured against an ordered list of rules. Every rule leaves a
// trace, so a decision can be explained line by line: which rule was checked,
// what it saw, and what it decided. BLOCK is sticky - once a rule refuses, the
// later rules are recorded as skipped rather than consulted.
//
// The rules are ordered so that the CLAMP rules run first: an amount that is
// cut down to the dust floor is then measured against the spending limits.
